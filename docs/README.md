# API Documentation Collection

This directory contains detailed documentation for various APIs used in our projects. Each markdown file provides comprehensive information about an API's capabilities, endpoints, and integration details. These documents serve as a reference for both human developers and AI assistants when building applications.

## Documentation Notice

**Important**: Historical documentation has been moved to the `/old/docs/` directory with date prefixes for better chronological tracking. If you're looking for previous documentation, please check there.

## Documentation Structure

Each API documentation file follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Basic information about the API
2. **Authentication** - How to authenticate with the API
3. **Available Endpoints** - Detailed endpoint documentation
4. **Integration Notes** - Best practices and implementation details
5. **Use Cases** - Common application scenarios
6. **Error Handling** - How to handle API errors
7. **Rate Limiting** - Usage limits and quotas

## Purpose

These documentation files are designed to be:

1. **AI-Readable** - Structured in a way that AI can easily parse and understand the capabilities
2. **Comprehensive** - Including all relevant details about the API
3. **Practical** - Focusing on real-world usage and integration
4. **Maintainable** - Easy to update as APIs evolve

## Adding New API Documentation

When adding documentation for a new API:

1. Create a new markdown file named appropriately (e.g., `api_name_v1.md`)
2. Follow the consistent documentation structure
3. Include all relevant details about authentication, endpoints, and usage
4. Update this README to include the new API documentation

## Archiving Documentation

When documentation becomes historical:

1. Move it to the `/old/docs/` directory
2. Add a date prefix in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_filename.md`
3. See `/old/README.md` for more details on the archiving system

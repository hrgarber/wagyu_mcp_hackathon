You
OK, all right so Quick story Harrison and I are competing in an AI hacker on this weekend Big money prize be to California and we're just like on Adderall building shit all right so the idea we came up with last night is related to sports gambling of course and It's an example for what your pitching stuff Give him the tiniest bit of background and then ask him why he's here so Brandon's gonna explain but I just got this advice from a person at work so sports betting and AI having up-to-date odds right when you ask yeah So get out of your mind that we're trying to break sports because I know that's your thing we're not we're not trying to break sports. We just we have access to all of the odds at all of the sports betting websites right now. 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
And so any any line any 

Reagan Shu
Powerful 

You
country any sports betting website we have we have all that data in. We don't have enough time to do it good enough yet for everything so our idea is major sports in the US right now so we're going. It's kind of a hard time. I know there's no sports if we can get hockey we'll see, but the idea is football basketball baseball yeah but but you know like it whatever to keep it small. So what 

Reagan Shu
What? 

You
imagine you know whether it's just asking for the odds or something but like we're trying to build out some cause like we have the decoding idea but we're trying to figure out like the most important thing is the demo and say like here's why someone would care you know and you're the person that would care so back to Brandon yeah So yeah, basically right now imagine working with ChatGPT and saying what is the line for this game 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
and yeah I mean or if you wanted or way more you could get you could get teams you could get what games are happening today you can get with the lines are for those specific lines You could arbitrage basically and say you know what are the lines for each of the different gambling sites So yeah, I mean I know it's based functionality. You're not like making money off of this, but like if if it was just in front of your lap, your ChatGPT that had access to the data. But this does this hackathon what we're doing and the whole purpose of like this is it's not new analytics like Brandon is saying it's removal of friction yeah that's just that's all it is so from 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
there we need ask us questions for we move to the next piece 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I'm at work but my first thoughts are like if you are assuming that you're you know like an avid gambler like having access to all of the different site a different lines of different ones cause they are gonna be different because each book is gonna be getting like a different sort of weight of like bats and money so like 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
the line will always be a little different I guess like if you know if you're if you're shopping basically like you can kinda turn it almost into like a shopping like marketplace like almost like thinking you know you can like OK if I want to take like you know 

You
Oh 

Reagan Shu
Kansas college basketball tonight right and I know that like you know some books will have them at four some at 4 1/2 some of them like the odds it'll be minimal but to a real better like those matter, you know also when it comes 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
to like inability to hedge having that little edge like does is convenient, especially when it comes to like futures are the big one like if you wanna bet on who's gonna be the 

You
Keep giving examples 

Reagan Shu
NFL like if you wanna be if you wanna be on who's gonna be the NFL MVP right? Most places to have like Lamar Jackson as a top one right but the actual number of the favorite like the actual odds are gonna be different based on how many people have bet through that book so like if you're looking to place a bet like that for futures, you wanna basically get the highest odds right even though it's the same debt so like 

You
Yeah, so so features is the most value because it's their long return bets give more time for the sports books to be there to be variation between the sports books more 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, yeah 

You
volatile OK, so can we like the ideas when we get back? I get back to Atlanta on Stuffle keep going for now because basically we have today. We have tomorrow tiny bit but we have today and we're just gonna grind. We're on Addie. We're doing all things we also have a fire going yeah we're cleaning Brandon smoker by smoking it really hard and 

Reagan Shu
Nice 

You
upset so Can you like the reason why we called you is cause we love you and 

Reagan Shu
Thank you I love you too. I'm happy you called. 

You
The other reason because we do love a lot of people is you know about sports but not like you though but more so what we need right now is like based off of what we can build right now and what we described we need like user stories or like actual like specific experiments or whatever you wanna call it so for example and I want you to use as reference, but like give the actual example Like say it was an AI thing instead of for sports betting is like Brandon doing his like project or support stuff like the other story could be. I have ticket number 002 and I want to know what was the message that the person sent regarding this ticket so I can quickly find out OK cool here's the message bang. Were there any similar messages to this OK bang so now if we go back to sports betting like if you take yourself say March madness you're putting together all your bets for March madness and you know you're doing that stuff give us some things you wanna ask or find out related to these odds are like even if there's a piece it's like a builder but like give us the user story your stories of like oh that'll be cool. 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I think so. Thinking of like March madness coming up right it's like underdog Central so I would say I want I 

You
Yeah, pick pick bullshit names without knowing anything to like feel like 

Reagan Shu
want. 

You
oil 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I would say like yeah I would. I would say something like I wanna pick the 12 seat to upset the five seed in 

You
Marymont around 16 or whatever 

Reagan Shu
every every division, right 

You
Hello 

Reagan Shu
Find me the best find me the highest odds for each of those 12 like test and then like I'm thinking I could say OK so if Nevada is offering you know loyal on their amount at like +9 00 but somebody else like DraftKings housing +925 right like obviously since you already had your mind made of who you wanna pick I'm thinking that would be like a way to basically direct somebody to where they can get the best odds 

You
OK, so we pivot we get more towards where are the on sale? 

Reagan Shu
Because like in theory right like a few or if you wanted to do that, I could open up each tab like if me and Brandon had a separate book I could say like I've done this before I was like hey I have a 

You
Yeah, yeah 

Reagan Shu
Stafford ass Super Bowl MVP at like +4 00 what do you have of that and he says oh I've got a +515 for like really peculiar particular bets like that they will actually be quite different 

You
Yeah, OK 

Reagan Shu
so I think like it it's kind of like it could 

You
OK 

Reagan Shu
eliminate it, centralized the different places you would pull from if you wanna do that That's by that's how I like if you gave it to me that's how I would first use it again knowing what I wanna bet so thinking of it as like something that helps you make a bet or help you choose your bet but helps you like literally confirm the choice that you've already kind of made coming into it 

You
Look up thought yeah no thoughts I think that's so. It's number one number two. Pretend you are either showing someone who's a semi nova sports better in like the hard-core sense you know they're putting together a bit or whatever but like they're not trying to just do some bullshit And say we got a Lakers game tonight that's now now run 

Reagan Shu
I would say So you're saying like you're casual better and you're like we're all getting to get a watch the Lakers game and you're like interested in something on it I would say 

You
Yeah, exactly exactly in my sports be friends and I'm like I wanna put a bed down six dudes on the couch and only one dude actually 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I would say 

You
bats and the others talk about it high-level 

Reagan Shu
like identifying identifying trends so like if somebody's like, but they like Lucas over his shit like it's like points rebounds and assists over his hit like the past three games or he's gone like 5 00 like something like that so maybe help you identify a trend that you can either like jump on or fade depending on what you wanna do but I guess like it'd be something to give you 

You
I want that and there might be part can I can I can? I slightly 

Reagan Shu
more 

You
reposition the idea the thing won't give you any old 

Reagan Shu
Yeah Yeah 

You
information. It will only give you future information or current information. 

Reagan Shu
Oh, OK. Up-to-date current information. 

You
We could add that though in the future 

Reagan Shu
Couldn't give you something like you know the Lakers or you know 40 12 and 

You
Yes 

Reagan Shu
13 against the spread like for like as far as the seasons gone 

You
Potentially there's a lot of I got a look potentially. I'm thinking even even lower of like I don't even know if this is real and that's why we're telling you, but I would be like OK. I like the 

Reagan Shu
Yeah Yeah, then I would actually, I would actually go this way if you wanna go yeah 

You
Lakers what if I like wanted to like a cake or watching the Lakers game yeah Reagan I know you got some crazy shit down while that's like. I don't even know what you said. I wanna throw one down who's your favorite player Luca just moved over that's cool. Let's make a bet with Luca. 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, yeah, I would also say 

You
Like how how do you how do you progress this to the point of a bit being placed yeah 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, like if you just provide like Lucas odds, you know like it cause that you can one there's multiple layers obviously like a 501 right like it's 23, 000 over 42 over under 42 which is like pretty standard for a guy like that, but you can do like over 60 and that's gonna be crazy odds or you can do like over under 20 and it's gonna be like safer odds so I think one you just have to keep in mind the options which most books will provide because They will it's part of it. I would also say just 

You
Even a little further back, I'm sorry to cut you off 

Reagan Shu
following like if it's. 

You
but with only the day Like The flow would be because we can build on if we get data but we have to like basically at this point say if we can just sort whatever we end up getting versus ask for something specific 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
So like you know if we get all of these normal odds of the spread money line whatever and then is there anything or spend money on the same no spread money line over under like basic basic basic basic basic basic 

Reagan Shu
Yeah Let me rewind for a second then I would say that another big thing that people want to look for, but it's hard to do is line movement so if there's a lot of action on specific debt, the line will move right like that like the books react by moving the line or moving the 

You
It's really OK 

Reagan Shu
odds and people look for people look for that yeah 

You
OK contextualize give me an example 

Reagan Shu
so I'll give you the best example that I can think of like two years ago Philadelphia and the Cowboys played and like came out at the starting quarterback for Philadelphia isn't gonna play so the line 

You
I got 

Reagan Shu
changes right? That's that's a pretty dressing. Example line changes cause they're going into it with a back up, so Philadelphia went from being like -3 favorites 2+ one underdog so if you had right like knowing that change, but I even think just like. 

You
Story API 

Reagan Shu
And less in less Jurassic context if there's like any baseball example on any given random day out of 162 gauge like July 8 in the middle of the fucking summer when nobody's watching a paying attention for whatever reason a lot of the people bet on the 

You
I love it 

Reagan Shu
braves to beat the White Sox right the White Sox are ass right that line move that has more people bet on the Braves line is gonna continue to move so if you think that you special at the end of the day, I should know what housing gonna happen on July 8 on a random day You can basically monitor the White Sox and be like the White Sox are randomly like +375 for this random day where it's both their fifth starters and nobody knows you playing games where you think you might basically just be like an advantage that's notable movement because people like movement and like movement draws attention because it kind of makes people Intrinsically wonder why is this moving like what is everybody else think about the Braves on this random day why not take the white Sox right Brandon do you remember that random game Houston versus Detroit Detroit was +400 and ended up winning right like it just a random day in the middle of summer so I think I like 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
baseball and basketball special like college basketball right those like random games will get a random amount of attention and if that moves whether it's for one way or another, it doesn't matter people like to know about movement 

You
So movement, you think is the biggest variable for people like like you said no one beats Vegas but if anyone's gonna try to beat Vegas, they they use movement as a massive variable for that movement of lines 

Reagan Shu
Yes, absolutely absolutely movement and waiting of waiting of the number of fats versus the money so like the amount of money on the game on one side of a bat is different than the amount of bets on one 

You
Would you 

Reagan Shu
side of the game 

You
be a thing you can find a thing you've ever seen where it's like 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, so 

You
there's this much money on one side of the bed 

Reagan Shu
some books will provide it like some of the new ones like FanDuel will do it like FanDuel DraftKings. They'll do that kind of stuff and again that's gonna be different for each book but yes, they will show you like what 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
percent of the money like what percent of the money is on which side versus what percent of the bets are on which side but they kinda break it down so you might be able to pull that 

You
Do you think it would do you think it would clutter a Response from a GPT if we showed that data along with the lines or you think that's like naturally, someone's gonna want that along with like if you're just like it with the line for the Lakers tonight and then you can say you can also you can show each 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
sports book and then you can also show like how much money is on each side and then maybe some like movement variable or something 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, but I mean people like oh it's literally a drop down underneath the lawn and some of these so like if you're if you click into the game and you see the 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
line the scale will pop up then it'll be like it'll look like almost an election chart like it'll be blue on one side red on the other and it'll say like 46 and 54 

You
Use 

Reagan Shu
% like 46 % of the money is on You know like the Lakers, but 54% of the bats are on whatever right like the opposite of it 

You
Yeah, so very important here is what your ear you're saying implicitly cause you have the information that's what I want so that you're seeing these things and you're saying the number of bets in like the value of the bets is important If you look at a snapshot in time right now you weren't tracking it just look right now. How like is it thresholds or is it like kind of a ratio of bets place to amount of money like what give us how you would analyze those two variables to help you OK 

Reagan Shu
It's Russia it's ratio it's ratio of basically the money like the total action on that game 

You
OK, so insert that that is this the Detroit game you're talking about Steelers is different now 

Reagan Shu
I can go for either. I get this interchangeable. We can make it to Detroit example if you want. 

You
Cell Give me both I'd like just like verbalize it 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, so like let's say you wanna bet on this Detroit versus Houston game Detroit is +400 

You
It's Tuesday at 

Reagan Shu
underdog yeah random day 

You
12 it's Tuesday at 12 space 

Reagan Shu
exactly and so 

You
Yes, random game 

Reagan Shu
you basically you click on it and the options come up right you have the run line you have to over under and then you have the money line and then below that is going to be I got a picture and election bar that has blue on the left and red on the right and it'll be equal 100 % but it'll basically show you what percent of the money is on which side and what percent of the best on which side? So in theory, why if you say OK I'm not like 80% of the best are on like that place like number of best place 80% of them of the total best place on that game through that site or on Houston basically clean up this game right but so in theory right like 20% of the best are on Try to beat them but 40% of the money actually place like a 

You
Home 

Reagan Shu
total the total action on that game numerical like currency wise 40% of the actual money bet is on Detroit And 60% of the total like pool is fat is that on 

You
Yeah, you're like oh interesting 

Reagan Shu
Houston so people would if people like to fade the public right like that's kind of a thing that better try to do the other one ride with the public or better or go against it cause you know think about it like if you're literally in your own head like Vegas know something that nobody else does right 

You
Public against public 

Reagan Shu
everybody's on you know Houston to win this game in Vegas is letting it happen and right like there must be like stupid shit like that, but the people do like to know what the number like where the weight is of the 

You
Yeah, yeah, can you give me like? 

Reagan Shu
public 

You
Role-play that person Who is doing that with that exact line walk me through the mental numbers Matthew do to say OK I see X on one side of number of bets. Why on the actual dollars placed on the bets let me like. Tell me your thought process that would lead you to I'm gonna bet on and the name X or Y or whatever side. 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, so I see that there's I see that there's a random game where you can get White Sox +400 which is quite absurd for again again where anything can happen in the middle of the summer so 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
naturally that's what like sparks my interest in clicking it and then assuming you strolling out the rest of the bets for that day and then once I'm in there, right, I see that 40% of the money is on Is on Detroit, which means that the email there's less that's on it. The people who are betting on Detroit are betting bigger on it right 

You
And that makes you feel 

Reagan Shu
like 

You
how and why 

Reagan Shu
That makes me feel that there's a small percentage of people that really believe in this day that believe Troy is going to you know 

You
Call mom 

Reagan Shu
that and that is also just like the idea of the odds are not in your favor, but the odds are great like for considering what the game is again being a middle of the road game that nobody cares about the payout on that if you really think it's just a 50-50 toss up like it's a no-brainer to take the one where you could quadruple your money right versus you know taking the safer bet that is again the team that is way better but again it's a baseball anything can happen 

You
In the social 

Reagan Shu
So if 

You
dynamics that you're describing from like you can infer from this information that is That like focusing on that piece, I'm trying to think of. I'm on all of the things right now. That kind of feeling that you're getting from it how does that intertwine with the top level piece that is +4 00 random summer game like how does that second layer 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
connect? 

Reagan Shu
Can you can you what do you mean by the second layer like so are you saying like what? 

You
So you say you're scrolling you click on it +400 random game OK cool and then you open it up and then you see like the The number, beds and money on each side and you see like a discrepancy that is you just described would be like make you even more enthusiastic to do that but like how Do you know what I'm saying like like how does that give you 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I see 

You
more conviction towards the bed like beyond when he clicked? 

Reagan Shu
Convinces either convinces or confirms to me the better that there's like value in the pic there's like 

You
Because 

Reagan Shu
because of the factors that include the potential payout being like you know four to one odds which is pretty people, but that's a pretty positive return so 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
that puff I would say the I mean, this is where it comes into like this is where it's tough because it's its personal preference right there might be somebody who there might be somebody who saw the 40% of the money is on 

You
Yeah, exactly exactly 

Reagan Shu
Detroit and it's like that nope get me away from this like I don't want it 

You
Why would they think that? 

Reagan Shu
For the same reason that I might like maybe they think it's rigged maybe they think there's something that they don't know maybe they don't like 

You
They have their reason OK you think there's like like not a deep state but you think there's more going on under the 

Reagan Shu
it maybe there's there's a reason I think 

You
surface and everyone has a unique reason like what is you don't give me yours but like what? What's your take on that you see? what were your numbers like? It was like 

Reagan Shu
Yeah Yeah Alex 

You
a lot of a lot of. Money relative to the number of bets on Detroit, right 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I would also say that a lot of people don't just just don't like anomalies like that game was an anomaly and that like people if they see an extreme one way or another, they will tend to stay away from it so that's a reason that people might get spooked out by a game like that 

You
When you say stay away like I am, I am so out of it like I don't know that how that would make it like you say out like it would make you stay out of that bet you're staring at right now or like 

Reagan Shu
It would make you make your avoid the game make you avoid that game like if I'm scrolling and I'm I wanna play a bet on a baseball game and I see that and I realize this is not normal. I'm clicking out of that I'm scrolling to the expert and seeing what other options I got. 

You
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah So if you're like a conservative better, you're like oh wow great odds you click on it. You're like this is funky. 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, exactly like you. You almost feel like you're getting trapped one way or another. 

You
That is like an anomaly in the deeper data 

Reagan Shu
So especially especially if it's especially if it's a beginner better who doesn't see it as like oh this might be a short tech where I may actually just get like I might swipe a 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
line that you know comes once every once in a while, a beginner better probably isn't gonna realize that which is why I say if you follow 

You
Yeah Yeah, yeah yeah yeah 

Reagan Shu
movement right like if something's moving like crazy a beginner better might be like I know right so they might 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
but if something steady right at the NFL for the most part is relatively steady those the lines they release on 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
Tuesday and by the time Sunday rolls around the lines rarely changed that much 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
so if there is a lot of change right, like I mean at the beginner better like football because it is pretty steady And it's less to keep up with right, so I think that movement can intimidate some people, especially the beginner better 

You
Yeah, OK I think I think we zoom out again. The most important thing is that everyone has their own philosophy and if you make you make receiving data super simple for them. 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, they'll take it as they want 

You
Easy and then we could even you know, we could take a step further down the line and help you know people can draft up their own like sort of strategies and then then retrieve data the way they want to retrieve it most importantly is If we make data collection, easy for people, though they might actually fucking use it and it kind of captures both the novice and the deep the deeper 

Reagan Shu
Yuck 

You
gambler with the deep state philosophy because if you're just an office and you're like I want you think the same thing I just want the lot and I want I want. I wanna place a bet tonight I wanna drink some beer yeah or if you're fucking if you really want to see the movement and see all the money down and you wanna run? It there so yeah the most important thing is the data is there we shouldn't give it all to someone we should like layer layered and based off of how much they 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, yeah and yeah yeah I would say don't don't 

You
want they don't overall so yeah 

Reagan Shu
overwhelm and don't maybe like don't try to come off like you're trying to help them make a pic like let them make their own empower them to make their own 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
decision which is 

You
So in the normal stats you get if if you're we say you're starting with I see a game and let's go back to the Lakers game cause it's just whatever I see the Lakers game I say hey tell me about the the odds on the Lakers game what do you want to see like what's your homepage look like cause that's very important to be sensitive not overwhelming the user so like what you're thinking in these kind of role-play 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
ways like, what do you? What populate when you ask for that and what doesn't 

Reagan Shu
So if I yeah, what what population is the spread over under in the money line that is like if you click on any bed that's gonna be the main thing there might be some like Especially if you click onto it in ESPN like if you click on that on the ESPN app and click into the game, there will be a little like pie chart that says like percent likely to win that's not related to the bedding. It's like the " ESPN expert analysis so some sites might have like a thing like that as well 

You
Yeah OK 

Reagan Shu
but that all that's not that's never the main like I stay that's always the kind like that's just up to it is it is 

You
Yeah, I got this BS so so yeah so here's my last one for you of like this line of thought Say you know how like you just pull up your phone if Siri actually worked and go hey Siri, you know like you'll send a text whatever 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
So OK Reagan is sitting here right now on a Saturday night. I have no clue who's playing, but if there's someone interesting to bet on, I have a feeling what U2 does right now so first is there do you know for tonight? Is there anything remotely interesting? 

Reagan Shu
I told you define interesting 

You
If you're not aware, it doesn't matter anyways, so we don't know what they are but make it up. What is someone who could be playing tonight that you would want to bet on? 

Reagan Shu
Yeah Yeah Call college Lakers and grizzlies 

You
Lakers grizzlies OK cool so you're sitting on your couch and you're interested in Lakers grizzlies so now tell me the whole story of Reagan is sitting on his couch and he pulls up his phone and says hey Siri 

Reagan Shu
I say hey Siri show me the line for Lakers grizzlies 

You
OK, and then populate the line and you gotta make up for the example whatever the line is to 

Reagan Shu
And then 

You
continue go 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I'll be it'll be. It'll be a serial populate and it'll probably say OK from a particular source like a particular book rather DraftKings FanDuel ESPN right whatever line that they 

You
Would you odyssey a like a top wait real quick 

Reagan Shu
decide out I would like to see. 

You
on the homepage example with like what do we see? What do we not see with this populate with the lines and you're talking about the different sports books? Would you rather beforehand either select what sports books if any how many like you wanna see do you want populate OK every time your DraftKings and here's FanDuel and Cuva for this piece to what how much populates or like did you choose it to populate it that way? 

Reagan Shu
If if there's a way to cause you know, assuming that not everybody has an account with everything if there's a way to tell what cycle I have an account with the account so I want to account I also have FanDuel I want to see if I have two accounts. I wanna see both because I wanna compare it like if they have if I think I like the Lakers and Lakers minus one and a half says Lakers minus one I'm gonna take the bottle one because that's you know it's helping my cause I believe in so if you have both, I wanna see both but a lot of people don't. 

You
OK so we could do beforehand in this whole processes you you tell the tool they're using through Siri Like literally typing in like to custom instruction I use Bota first and then FanDuel or and we have a default that populates would you say just populate one line or would you say 

Reagan Shu
Yes 

You
populate like I don't know if there's like a three 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
everyone uses or you know what I mean, like what the default be 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, if I would, I would say give pick one that is the default like pick one both state draft case and that's just gonna Caesar sports that better. Caesar sports book is the default yeah like Cesar sports book is the 

You
OK, should we? 

Reagan Shu
default right that you can compare contrast or 

You
Yeah, yeah 

Reagan Shu
whatever I would also say that like it is worth providing the other options because you know somebody may want to create an account at another one right like some 

You
Do we for that that bit of providing the other 

Reagan Shu
people. 

You
options in an interaction standpoint is it more of a set up or a we actually like prompt them? Hey do you want to you know kinda like the opt out on the websites for like do you wanna let us steal all your data like they kinda 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
shove please click except and you have to go through a lot to say no. Should we do something like that words like 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
before you know at some point before this interaction You say all those things or like do we do we make it so it's like hey also would you like to blah blah blah? 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I'll say the ladder if I also in case like if you were interested in one of these other books, you know view them like here are your options 

You
Yeah, cool OK so you said hey show me the stuff. Keep going with the story. 

Reagan Shu
Yes, I say hey show me the lines for for Lakers grizzlies. I assume it populate and I scroll and I basically. If I if I know, I wanna bet on it right if I didn't, it just comes down. What do I like right if I see it and I like it, I would want to be able to I would want to be able to from there like from that 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
prompt response prompt I wanna be able to click on it and access whatever I like whatever site I bet on like I don't want. I don't wanna read that then go on my phone and say OK now I wanna go make this I wanna be able to click from there yeah 

You
OK So pretend that did happen, but it won't happen because yes but like 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
pretend the once you mentally say I wanna place a bet. It just displaced pretend the actual placing it doesn't matter so so what's your 

Reagan Shu
OK 

You
headspace when you go into saying Siri? Are you what bed are you already thinking of you just waiting to see what populates like what what what is your yeah 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I'm waiting to see what I'm going to especially if I'm just hanging around on Saturday night like casually I just wanna see what's option. I want to scroll almost like I wanna shop. I wanna see you like what like what matches are five interesting because also you know everybody's gonna have personal preference right like I don't care about that on soccer tonight. I don't care if I'm betting on 

You
OK 

Reagan Shu
basketball like maybe I just wanna bet on the game that's on ESPN then I'll be able to watch right every individual be different so I wanna see the 

You
Yeah, OK so yeah if you say OK the Lakers are the one and you get 

Reagan Shu
options. 

You
your was the three money line over under spread. OK you get money on over under spread after saying hey show me this continue. 

Reagan Shu
So that populate 

You
Yeah, those those three things populate the story ends with OK that's my bad 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I mean I shop. I click in base and I make the decision right like that in a weird way like if if I see what I see I like I will place it. 

You
So that's all you need to see like it is you see the three and then you're like OK like like 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
that you don't you want the other stuff you want the things we described the money and Betts place splits and all that but at its lowest level that is enough information for you to gain the conviction to then say yes OK 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, at the lowest level, I can see it and like it and make the decision based on that and honestly that's what I usually do like for me 

You
mentally that place 

Reagan Shu
personally, I scroll I see it now if I am like more curious and I wanna look into it I want to feel like I'm making a more informed decision. That's why I want the details of OK. What's the weight of the money? What's the weight of the bet option 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
Like those are the things that I will once like in a way think of it is like OK like I've almost like considered my option right like I've decided that the Lakers grizzly game looks good. It's interesting. It's on TV. I want that on it now I want now I wanna make my pic. OK now I wanna see OK what are people betting on? What's the money on the money on the grizzlies and the money on the 

You
Yeah OK 

Reagan Shu
Lakers or is everybody avoiding the under for some reason right like that's why I would want to look at that and 

You
Cell 

Reagan Shu
that again like when you when you read those things and you see him it'll it. Basically get you to 

You
Yeah 

Reagan Shu
like one pick one choice of the other options that you get and then you make it 

You
OK, so then you say you see the Lakers give me a line that you would say who I want that 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, Lakers -4 1/2 against at home against the grizzlies I like it I'm I'm taking the Lakers -4 1/2 

You
And who are you taking? OK, take the Lakers 4 1/2 you see that and you go fuck yeah and 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
then I'm guessing there's some people who then or do the lines fluctuate much on a regular season basketball game like would you actually still care to see the other ones? 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, I would because it's like we're not when I think about line fluctuation is what is the lunch start at and where am I looking at it now? 

You
Like the past state is hard but like OK I want the Lakers -4 1/ 

Reagan Shu
Cell 

You
2 OK cool at that point since it's like you know there's a lot of money in predicting the lines are we thinking that Bodda in DraftKings and Vand all are saying 4 1/2 or five that's gonna be before though he comes before he picked the line with the person before when you say I like that and then see if you can do better well you're probably saying I like that after you see the different line OK so you're like OK I'm intrigued by a 4 1/ 2. Let's see like what what are the lines I can get kind of around this from all the places like you know it seems like Lakers have pretty good odds right now let me see what all the ones I 

Reagan Shu
Yeah 

You
want. It seems like select the sport. Select the game look at all the odds game and then select your line. Based off of the lines, you can get based off lines you can get it 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, so yeah yeah exactly 

You
Yeah, that's that's it 

Reagan Shu
Yeah, yes, love it 

You

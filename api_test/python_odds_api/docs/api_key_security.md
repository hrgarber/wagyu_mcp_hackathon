# API Key Security

## Current Status

After investigating the repository, we've confirmed that:

1. The `.env` file containing your API key is **not currently tracked by git**
2. The API key `22c87ba01f0fecd6a3acbf114ebcb940` does **not appear in the git history**
3. The `.gitignore` file is correctly configured to ignore `.env` files

This means your API key is currently secure and has not been exposed in the git history.

## Implemented Security Measures

We've created a new branch `feature/git_action_.env` with git hooks to prevent accidentally committing API keys or `.env` files in the future:

1. **Pre-commit hook**: Automatically runs checks before each commit
2. **Environment file check**: Prevents committing `.env` files
3. **API key pattern detection**: Scans for API keys in staged changes

## How to Use the Git Hooks

1. Check out the `feature/git_action_.env` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/git_action_.env
   ```

2. Run the setup script once:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .github/scripts/setup.sh
   .github/scripts/setup.sh
   ```

3. The hooks will now run automatically before each commit, preventing accidental exposure of API keys.

### For New Developers

When new developers clone the repository, they only need to run the setup script once:

```bash
chmod +x .github/scripts/setup.sh
.github/scripts/setup.sh
```

This configures Git to use the hooks from `.github/hooks` instead of the default `.git/hooks` directory, making the hooks a default part of the repository.

## Best Practices for API Key Security

1. **Never commit `.env` files**: Store sensitive information in environment variables
2. **Use `.env.example` files**: Provide templates without real values
3. **Rotate API keys regularly**: Change keys periodically, especially after suspected exposure
4. **Use different keys**: Use separate keys for development, testing, and production
5. **Set up access controls**: Limit who has access to production API keys

## What to Do If You Accidentally Commit an API Key

If you accidentally commit an API key:

1. **Rotate the key immediately**: Generate a new key from the service provider
2. **Remove from git history**: Use tools like `git-filter-repo` to remove sensitive data
3. **Force push**: Update the remote repository with the cleaned history
4. **Notify team members**: Ensure everyone pulls the updated history

# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation to track the project's development journey.

## Purpose

The purpose of this archive is to chronologically document the development process through markdown and text files. This helps preserve the history of decisions, plans, and implementations without modifying the original documents.

## Structure

```
old/
├── README.md  (this file)
└── docs/      (all historical documents)
```

## Adding Documents

1. When a document becomes historical, copy it to the `docs/` directory
2. Add date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD_filename.md`
3. Don't modify documents after archiving

## Guidelines

- Only add markdown (.md) and text (.txt) files
- Always include the date prefix in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_`
- Original files should remain in their original locations
- This system is intentionally minimal and can evolve as needed

All MD and TXT files are welcome. No complex organization required.

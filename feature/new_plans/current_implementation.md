# Current Implementation Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the current implementation of the Wagyu Sports API client. Understanding the current implementation is essential for planning the enhancements.

## Key Files

The current implementation consists of the following key files:

- `wagyu_sports/odds_client.py`: The main client class
- `wagyu_sports/utils.py`: Utility functions
- `wagyu_sports/examples/`: Example scripts
- `wagyu_sports/tests/`: Test files

## OddsClient Class

The `OddsClient` class in `odds_client.py` is the main entry point for the API client. It provides methods for fetching sports data, odds, and scores from The Odds API.

### Key Methods

- `get_sports(all_sports=False)`: Get a list of available sports
- `get_odds(sport, options=None)`: Get odds for a specific sport
- `make_request(endpoint, params=None)`: Make a request to the API

### Current Implementation Limitations

1. **No Credit Tracking**: The client doesn't track or estimate API credit usage
2. **No Caching**: The client doesn't cache responses, leading to unnecessary API calls
3. **No Parameter Validation**: The client doesn't validate parameters before making API calls
4. **Limited Granularity**: The client provides broad methods that can consume multiple API credits
5. **No Default Settings**: The client doesn't provide configurable default settings

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the current client is used:

```python
from wagyu_sports import OddsClient
import os

# Initialize client
api_key = os.getenv("ODDS_API_KEY")
client = OddsClient(api_key)

# Get a list of sports
sports_response = client.get_sports()
print(f"Found {len(sports_response['data'])} sports")

# Get odds for a specific sport
odds_response = client.get_odds("basketball_nba", {
    "regions": "us",
    "markets": "h2h"
})
print(f"Found odds for {len(odds_response['data'])} events")
```

## API Response Structure

The API responses have the following structure:

### Sports Endpoint

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "key": "basketball_nba",
      "group": "Basketball",
      "title": "NBA",
      "description": "US Basketball",
      "active": true,
      "has_outrights": false
    },
    ...
  ],
  "headers": {
    "x-requests-remaining": "499",
    "x-requests-used": "1"
  }
}
```

### Odds Endpoint

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1234567890",
      "sport_key": "basketball_nba",
      "sport_title": "NBA",
      "commence_time": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "home_team": "Los Angeles Lakers",
      "away_team": "Golden State Warriors",
      "bookmakers": [
        {
          "key": "fanduel",
          "title": "FanDuel",
          "last_update": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          "markets": [
            {
              "key": "h2h",
              "outcomes": [
                {
                  "name": "Los Angeles Lakers",
                  "price": 2.1
                },
                {
                  "name": "Golden State Warriors",
                  "price": 1.8
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "headers": {
    "x-requests-remaining": "498",
    "x-requests-used": "2"
  }
}
```

## API Credit Usage

The API has a credit-based usage system, where different endpoints and parameters consume different amounts of credits:

- `/sports` endpoint: Free (0 credits)
- `/odds` endpoint: 1 credit per region per market
- `/scores` endpoint: 1-2 credits depending on parameters
- `/events` endpoint: Free (0 credits)
- `/historical/odds` endpoint: 10 credits per region per market

## Enhancement Opportunities

Based on the current implementation, there are several opportunities for enhancement:

1. **Credit Tracking**: Add utilities to track and estimate API credit usage
2. **Response Archiving**: Implement a permanent archive of API responses for testing and mocking
3. **Parameter Validation**: Add validation to prevent errors and wasted credits
4. **Granular API Methods**: Add endpoint-specific methods for precise control over API costs
5. **Configurable Default Settings**: Add configurable defaults for easier usage
6. **Single-Event Focus Methods**: Add methods that focus on single events to minimize API usage

These enhancements will improve the client's usability, efficiency, and maintainability.

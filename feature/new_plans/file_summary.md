## File Descriptions

### Main Files

- **README.md**: Main index file that links to all sections and provides a summary of the enhancement plan.
- **current_implementation.md**: Analysis of the current implementation of the Wagyu Sports API client.
- **mcp_implementation.md**: Plan for implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Wagyu Sports.
- **file_summary.md**: This file, which provides a summary of all the files created for the enhancement plan.

### Section Files

1. **01_overview/README.md**: Provides an overview of the enhancement plan, including the directory structure changes and key improvements.
2. **02_granular_api_methods/README.md**: Details the implementation of granular API methods for precise control over API costs.
3. **03_credit_tracking/README.md**: Explains the implementation of credit tracking and estimation utilities.
4. **04_response_archive/README.md**: Describes the implementation of a permanent archive of API responses for testing and mocking.
5. **05_parameter_validation/README.md**: Outlines the implementation of parameter validation to prevent errors and wasted credits.
6. **06_configurable_settings/README.md**: Details the implementation of configurable default settings for easier usage.
7. **07_single_event_methods/README.md**: Explains the implementation of single-event focus methods to minimize API usage.
8. **08_implementation_timeline/README.md**: Provides a timeline for implementing the enhancements, including estimated time for each round.
9. **09_project_context/README.md**: Provides context about the project, the requirements for the enhancement, and the decisions made during the planning process.

## Summary of the Plan

The enhancement plan focuses on:

1. **API Credit Efficiency**: Optimizing API usage to minimize credit consumption
2. **Response Archiving**: Implementing a permanent archive of API responses for testing and mocking
3. **Modular Design**: Restructuring the codebase for better maintainability
4. **Enhanced Functionality**: Adding new methods for more granular control

These enhancements will prepare the module for future MCP integration while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation is planned in 6 rounds:

1. **Round 1**: Directory structure & packaging
2. **Round 2**: Response archive system
3. **Round 3**: Parameter validation
4. **Round 4**: Granular API methods
5. **Round 5**: Credit tracking & utilities
6. **Round 6**: Configurable settings & single-event methods

The total estimated time for implementation is 9-15 hours.

## Next Steps

After reviewing this plan, the next steps are:

1. Create a feature branch for implementation
2. Follow the implementation timeline outlined in [Section 8](08_implementation_timeline/README.md)
3. Test the enhancements thoroughly
4. Update documentation
5. Merge the feature branch to main

# MCP Python SDK Learning and Development Plan

## Phase 1: Understanding MCP Core Concepts

### 1. Core Architecture Study
- Review MCP client-server architecture
- Understand protocol layers:
  - Protocol layer (message framing, request/response)
  - Transport layer (stdio, SSE)
  - Message types (requests, responses, notifications)
- Study connection lifecycle (initialization, message exchange, termination)

### 2. Key Components Analysis
- Resources: File-like data accessible by clients
- Tools: Executable functions called by LLMs
- Prompts: Pre-written templates for specific tasks
- Roots: Boundaries for server operations
- Sampling: LLM completion requests through clients

## Phase 2: Python SDK Deep Dive

### 1. SDK Setup and Environment
- Set up Python development environment
- Install Python SDK (version 1.2.0+)
- Review SDK documentation and examples

### 2. Core SDK Components
- Study FastMCP class for simplified tool definitions
- Understand async/await patterns in SDK
- Review error handling and logging mechanisms
- Examine transport implementations

## Phase 3: Example Tool Development

### 1. Initial Planning
- Define tool purpose: Create a simple file analysis tool
- Scope core functionality:
  - File content reading
  - Basic text analysis (word count, line count, etc.)
  - Pattern matching/search
  - Results formatting

### 2. Implementation Steps
1. Basic server setup with stdio transport
2. Tool definition using FastMCP
3. Core functionality implementation
4. Error handling and input validation
5. Testing with MCP Inspector
6. Integration with Claude Desktop

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with MCP Inspector
- End-to-end testing with Claude Desktop
- Edge case and error handling verification

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 1. Additional Capabilities
- Resource implementation for file caching
- Prompt templates for common operations
- Sampling integration for enhanced analysis
- Progress reporting for long operations

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Optimize large file handling
- Add concurrent operation support
- Monitor and improve response times

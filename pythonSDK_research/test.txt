This is a test file for our MCP file analysis server.
It contains multiple lines of text to analyze.
We can count words, lines, and search for patterns.

Some example patterns to try:
- Email: test@example.com
- URL: https://modelcontextprotocol.io
- Numbers: 123, 456, 789

The file analysis tool should be able to:
1. Count total words
2. Count total lines
3. Find patterns using regex
4. Report file size and basic info
